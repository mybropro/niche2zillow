# niche2zillow
Small extension that adds links from [Niche](https://niche.com) to relevant [Zillow](https://zillow.com) searches.
Found myself looking on Niche then Ctrl+C -> Ctrl+V into Zillow for each area. This extension adds links to make that unncessary.

### Features
* Links on town/neighborhood/city/state pages that link to a Zillow search of the area.
* Link on each search result.

### TODO:
- [ ] Make icons (16, 32, 64, 128 pngs)
- [ ] Background Zillow searching to show number of houses in that area. ex: "View on Zillow (5 houses)"
- [ ] Swap "View Nearby Houses" from linking to [movoto.com](https://movoto.com) to the analogous Zillow page.
- [ ] Publish on chrome store/other way to package
